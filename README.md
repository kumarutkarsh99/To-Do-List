To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List app built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, mark tasks as complete or pending, and prioritize tasks. The app also uses local storage to persist the data, ensuring that your tasks remain even after the browser is closed.

Features

- Add Tasks: Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Edit Tasks: Edit task descriptions.
- Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
- Complete Tasks: Mark tasks as complete or pending.
- Priority Tasks: Mark tasks as high priority using a star icon.
- Filter Tasks: Filter tasks based on their status (All, Completed, Pending, Priority).
- Persistent Data: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so the list remains even after a page reload.

Tech Stack

- React: Front-end framework to build the UI.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.
- Local Storage: Used to persist the to-do list data across browser sessions.

Usage

- Adding a task: Type the task description in the input field and press "Enter" or click the "+" button.
- Editing a task: Click the pencil icon next to a task to edit it. After editing, click the save icon to save the changes.
- Deleting a task: Click the trash can icon to remove a task from the list.
- Marking as complete: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
- Prioritizing a task: Click the star icon next to a task to mark it as high priority.
- Filtering tasks: Use the filter buttons at the top to view all tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks, or priority tasks.
